The bakery opened before dawn, filling the neighborhood with the irresistible aroma of fresh bread. The baker worked tirelessly, pulling golden loaves from the oven and arranging pastries in the display case. Regular customers lined up, knowing that the best items sold out quickly. Croissants, still warm and flaky, disappeared within minutes. The coffee machine steamed and hissed, producing rich espresso for grateful morning commuters.
