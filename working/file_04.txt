In the bustling marketplace, vendors called out their wares with practiced enthusiasm. Fresh produce was arranged in colorful pyramids, while spices filled the air with exotic scents. Customers haggled good-naturedly over prices, a tradition as old as the market itself. Children darted between the stalls, playing games and occasionally stopping to admire the toys on display. The energy was infectious, drawing in tourists and locals alike.
