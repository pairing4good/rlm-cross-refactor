The mountain trail wound its way through dense forest, occasionally opening up to reveal breathtaking vistas of the valley below. Hikers made their way steadily upward, their boots crunching on the gravel path. A small stream paralleled the trail, its water crystal clear and refreshingly cold. Birds chirped in the canopy above, creating a natural symphony. The air grew thinner as the elevation increased, but the views made every step worthwhile.
