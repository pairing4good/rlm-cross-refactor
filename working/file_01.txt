The morning sun cast long shadows across the empty parking lot. A lone crow perched on the streetlight, observing the scene below with keen interest. The wind picked up, rustling through the nearby trees and sending a few stray leaves dancing across the pavement. In the distance, the sound of traffic hummed steadily, a constant reminder of the city's pulse. The day promised to be clear and bright, perfect for outdoor activities.
