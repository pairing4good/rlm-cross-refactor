The garden flourished in the summer heat, a riot of colors and fragrances. Roses climbed trellises while lavender bordered the stone pathways. Butterflies flitted from flower to flower, and bees hummed industriously. The gardener had spent years cultivating this paradise, learning which plants thrived in each microclimate. A small fountain provided a soothing soundtrack, its water sparkling in the sun. Visitors often remarked that time seemed to slow down here.
