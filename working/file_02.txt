Ancient manuscripts lined the shelves of the library, each one containing stories from civilizations long past. The librarian carefully cataloged each volume, noting its condition and provenance. Dust motes floated in the afternoon light that streamed through the tall windows. The smell of old paper and leather bindings filled the air, creating an atmosphere of scholarly reverence. Students quietly studied at wooden tables, their heads bent over thick textbooks.
